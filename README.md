# Powang programming language | WIP
Hiii, this is POLA, a software engineering student, and this is my own programming language :D  

> [!WARNING]
> It's still work in progress so expect to encounter bugs or undefined behaviours.

## TODO
- [X] Comments `##`.
- [X] `number`.
- [X] `string`.
- [X] `list`.
- [X] `expression`.
- [X] Standard console output `stdout`.
- [X] Fancy print with `print` (almost 1:1 with python print).
- [ ] User types.
- - [ ] Methods.
- - [ ] Inheritance.
- [ ] Functions.
- - [ ] Declare.
- - [ ] Define.
- - [ ] Profiles (like C++ templates).
- [ ] A good lexical analysis.
- [ ] Pointers.
- [ ] Logical operators.
- [ ] User error handling.
- [ ] Decide when to preprocess the tokens into values and when into raw tokens.

## Get started
You need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) obviously.  
You need [Python3](https://www.python.org/) (I will migrate to C++ probably).

- Clone the repository with:  
```git clone https://github.com/POLA-LCS/powang```

Go to `./powang`  
Run `powang.py --help`  
Create the file `main.po`   
Write your first hello world with `stdout 'Hello, world!\n'`  
Run it with `powang.py main.po`
